		<p id="biography">As his name implies, Lord Viscount Foster Lockwood III, Esq., is a Lord of the Green Mountains. He is also very tall, as although he is the first member of his family with his name, he requires the “III” title after his name to contain all of his altitudinal awesomeness. He is the first Mate in a while to be able to sign in on the ceiling without standing on a chair, and thus will be used to direct air traffic in the near future, either by signal, or by diverting upper atmospheric air currents with his upper body.</p>
