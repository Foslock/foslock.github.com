		<p id="biography">Foster, born and raised in Burlington, VT has been programming from his early days in middle school. Since then, his skills have been vastly expanded and refined at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Expecting to graduate in May, 2013, he is excited to complete his BSCS from the school of engineering and his minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership. When he isn't hacking together his most recent pet project, you can find him singing with his a cappella group or out in Boston meeting other developers.</p>
